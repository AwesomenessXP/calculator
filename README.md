# Calculator
- Still practicing JavaScript by making a [calculator](https://awesomenessxp.github.io/calculator/).
# Challenges
## Creating all the buttons in JS + styling
- styled the number pad by row from 0-9
- some exceptions required using the column ID's to style columns
## Concatenating numbers on screen and do multiple operations
- used `screen.textContent = screen.textContent + num;` to add previous text to current text
- pushed new digits into array, then used `.join('')` to save array in `calcTwoNums.secondNum` as a string
# Features to implement
- add backspace button (make CE button functional)
- add decimal button (make decimal button functional)
